- **Automatic Burn Scar Mapping**: Deep Learning models process images to identify fire scars.  
- **Cloud Masking**: Automatic cloud detection improves classification accuracy.  
- **Interactive Map**: Results displayed on a dynamic map with multiple layers.  
- **Exporting**: Users can download fire scar maps in GeoJSON, SHP, or CSV formats.  
- **Historical Data**: Provides access to past fire events for long-term monitoring.  
- **Metadata Access**: Displays key image metadata for transparency and analysis.  

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, Swagger, Jest  
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, React Leaflet, Jest, HTML5, CSS  
- **AI / Deep Learning**: Python for training and inference of burn scar detection models  
- **Agile Methodology**: SCRUM for sprint-based delivery, GitHub Projects for Kanban & Burndown  

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was to process large-scale geospatial data efficiently while maintaining accuracy in burn scar detection. The team learned to integrate Deep Learning models with cloud-optimized geospatial formats, optimize APIs for heavy image processing, and deliver a user-friendly frontend with real-time map visualization.

## Outcome

**D-FireTrack** has delivered multiple sprint releases, each validated with functioning features and improved precision. It is a crucial step toward scalable, automated fire monitoring in Brazil and beyond.  
The project was recognized within the academic environment for combining AI, cloud computing, and geospatial sciences into a practical, real-world solution.

Before getting into tech, I spent 5 years working in the aviation industry, where I built a strong foundation in critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving. I officially started my journey in software in 2023, and since then, I’ve been focused on building web solutions that are fast, scalable, and add real value to businesses. I’m always learning, always improving, and always looking for better ways to solve problems through code."},"work":{"title":"Work Experience","experiences":{"embraer":{"role":"Full Stack Developer","achievements":{"1":"Built a scheduling system for the aerospace division that was ranked among the top 10 intern projects across the company.","2":"Created ETL and data analysis tools that helped improve resource planning and decision-making.","3":"Led modernization efforts on internal systems to improve backend performance and user experience."}},"nexus":{"role":"Software Developer","achievements":{"1":"Migrated a legacy .NET system to Next.js, cutting file generation time from 2 minutes to just 1 second.","2":"Built a real-time data processing server using Node.js, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL for IoT devices.","3":"Developed a modern dashboard in React/Next.js to visualize and analyze IoT data."}}}},"studies":{"title":"Education","institutions":{"fatec":{"description":"I'm currently studying Multiplatform Software Development at FATEC Jacareí and expect to graduate in December 2025."},"utfpr":{"description":"I studied Systems Analysis and Development at UTFPR between 2021 and 2022."},"dublin":{"description":"I spent a year in Dublin, Ireland studying English and earned a B2 level certificate."}}},"technical":{"title":"Tech Skills","skills":{"node":{"description":"I build backend applications with Node.js and TypeScript, following clean architecture and best practices."},"react":{"description":"I design responsive and scalable user interfaces with React and Next.js, always focusing on performance and UX."},"postgresql":{"description":"I work with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM to manage data reliably and efficiently in relational databases."}}}},"blog":{"label":"Blog","title":"Thoughts on dev, career, and tech","description":"Here’s what I’ve been thinking and writing about lately."},"work":{"label":"Projects","title":"My Projects","description":"Some of the things I’ve built — all focused on solving real problems with thoughtful, high-quality code."},"projectCard":{"label":"Read more"},"gallery":{"label":"Gallery","title":"Photo Gallery","description":"A collection of snapshots from moments that inspire me — on and off the screen."}},"children":["$","$L8",null,{"as":"html","lang":"en","background":"page","data-neutral":"gray","data-brand":"emerald","data-accent":"indigo","data-solid":"contrast","data-solid-style":"flat","data-theme":"dark","data-border":"playful","data-surface":"translucent","data-transition":"all","className":"__variable_1910d2 __variable_81a259","children":["$","$L8",null,{"style":{"minHeight":"100vh"},"as":"body","fillWidth":true,"margin":"0","padding":"0","direction":"column","children":[["$","$L10",null,{"mask":"cursor","gradient":{"display":true,"opacity":0.4},"dots":{"display":true,"opacity":0.4,"size":"24"},"lines":{"display":false}}],["$","$L8",null,{"fillWidth":true,"minHeight":"16"}],["$","$L11",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"zIndex":0,"fillWidth":true,"paddingY":"l","paddingX":"l","justifyContent":"center","flex":1,"children":["$","$L8",null,{"justifyContent":"center","fillWidth":true,"minHeight":"0","children":["$","$L12",null,{"children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","$4","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","$L8",null,{"as":"section","direction":"column","alignItems":"center","children":[["$","$L13",null,{"marginBottom":"s","variant":"display-strong-xl","children":"404"}],["$","$L14",null,{"marginBottom":"l","variant":"display-strong-xs","children":"Page Not Found"}],["$","$L13",null,{"onBackground":"neutral-weak","children":"The page you are looking for does not exist."}]]}],"notFoundStyles":[]}]}]}]}],["$","$L8",null,{"as":"footer","position":"relative","fillWidth":true,"padding":"8","justifyContent":"center","mobileDirection":"column","children":[["$","$L8",null,{"className":"Footer_mobile__TYNqJ","fillWidth":true,"maxWidth":"m","paddingY":"8","paddingX":"16","gap":"16","justifyContent":"space-between","alignItems":"center","children":[["$","$L13",null,{"variant":"body-default-s","onBackground":"neutral-strong","children":[["$","$L13",null,{"onBackground":"neutral-weak","children":["© ",2025," /"]}],["$","$L13",null,{"paddingX":"4","children":"Michael Morais"}]]}],["$","$L8",null,{"gap":"16","children":[["$","$L15","GitHub",{"href":"https://github.com/itsmorais","icon":"github","tooltip":"GitHub","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}],["$","$L15","LinkedIn",{"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-morais22/","icon":"linkedin","tooltip":"LinkedIn","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}],"",["$","$L15","Email",{"href":"mailto:michael.morais@fatec.sp.gov.br","icon":"email","tooltip":"Email","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}]]}]]}],["$","$L8",null,{"height":"80","show":"s"}]]}]]}]}]}]
