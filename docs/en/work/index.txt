Before getting into tech, I spent 5 years working in the aviation industry, where I built a strong foundation in critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving. I officially started my journey in software in 2023, and since then, I’ve been focused on building web solutions that are fast, scalable, and add real value to businesses. I’m always learning, always improving, and always looking for better ways to solve problems through code."},"work":{"title":"Work Experience","experiences":{"embraer":{"role":"Full Stack Developer","achievements":{"1":"Built a scheduling system for the aerospace division that was ranked among the top 10 intern projects across the company.","2":"Created ETL and data analysis tools that helped improve resource planning and decision-making.","3":"Led modernization efforts on internal systems to improve backend performance and user experience."}},"nexus":{"role":"Software Developer","achievements":{"1":"Migrated a legacy .NET system to Next.js, cutting file generation time from 2 minutes to just 1 second.","2":"Built a real-time data processing server using Node.js, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL for IoT devices.","3":"Developed a modern dashboard in React/Next.js to visualize and analyze IoT data."}}}},"studies":{"title":"Education","institutions":{"fatec":{"description":"I'm currently studying Multiplatform Software Development at FATEC Jacareí and expect to graduate in December 2025."},"utfpr":{"description":"I studied Systems Analysis and Development at UTFPR between 2021 and 2022."},"dublin":{"description":"I spent a year in Dublin, Ireland studying English and earned a B2 level certificate."}}},"technical":{"title":"Tech Skills","skills":{"node":{"description":"I build backend applications with Node.js and TypeScript, following clean architecture and best practices."},"react":{"description":"I design responsive and scalable user interfaces with React and Next.js, always focusing on performance and UX."},"postgresql":{"description":"I work with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM to manage data reliably and efficiently in relational databases."}}}},"blog":{"label":"Blog","title":"Thoughts on dev, career, and tech","description":"Here’s what I’ve been thinking and writing about lately."},"work":{"label":"Projects","title":"My Projects","description":"Some of the things I’ve built — all focused on solving real problems with thoughtful, high-quality code."},"projectCard":{"label":"Read more"},"gallery":{"label":"Gallery","title":"Photo Gallery","description":"A collection of snapshots from moments that inspire me — on and off the screen."}},"children":["$","$L8",null,{"as":"html","lang":"en","background":"page","data-neutral":"gray","data-brand":"emerald","data-accent":"indigo","data-solid":"contrast","data-solid-style":"flat","data-theme":"dark","data-border":"playful","data-surface":"translucent","data-transition":"all","className":"__variable_3587c5 __variable_81a259","children":["$","$L8",null,{"style":{"minHeight":"100vh"},"as":"body","fillWidth":true,"margin":"0","padding":"0","direction":"column","children":[["$","$L11",null,{"mask":"cursor","gradient":{"display":true,"opacity":0.4},"dots":{"display":true,"opacity":0.4,"size":"24"},"lines":{"display":false}}],["$","$L8",null,{"fillWidth":true,"minHeight":"16"}],["$","$L12",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"zIndex":0,"fillWidth":true,"paddingY":"l","paddingX":"l","justifyContent":"center","flex":1,"children":["$","$L8",null,{"justifyContent":"center","fillWidth":true,"minHeight":"0","children":["$","$L13",null,{"children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","$4","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","$L8",null,{"as":"section","direction":"column","alignItems":"center","children":[["$","$L14",null,{"marginBottom":"s","variant":"display-strong-xl","children":"404"}],["$","$L15",null,{"marginBottom":"l","variant":"display-strong-xs","children":"Page Not Found"}],["$","$L14",null,{"onBackground":"neutral-weak","children":"The page you are looking for does not exist."}]]}],"notFoundStyles":[]}]}]}]}],["$","$L8",null,{"as":"footer","position":"relative","fillWidth":true,"padding":"8","justifyContent":"center","mobileDirection":"column","children":[["$","$L8",null,{"className":"Footer_mobile__TYNqJ","fillWidth":true,"maxWidth":"m","paddingY":"8","paddingX":"16","gap":"16","justifyContent":"space-between","alignItems":"center","children":[["$","$L14",null,{"variant":"body-default-s","onBackground":"neutral-strong","children":[["$","$L14",null,{"onBackground":"neutral-weak","children":["© ",2025," /"]}],["$","$L14",null,{"paddingX":"4","children":"Michael Morais"}]]}],["$","$L8",null,{"gap":"16","children":[["$","$L16","GitHub",{"href":"https://github.com/itsmorais","icon":"github","tooltip":"GitHub","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}],["$","$L16","LinkedIn",{"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-morais22/","icon":"linkedin","tooltip":"LinkedIn","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}],"",["$","$L16","Email",{"href":"mailto:michael.morais@fatec.sp.gov.br","icon":"email","tooltip":"Email","size":"s","variant":"ghost"}]]}]]}],["$","$L8",null,{"height":"80","show":"s"}]]}]]}]}]}]
