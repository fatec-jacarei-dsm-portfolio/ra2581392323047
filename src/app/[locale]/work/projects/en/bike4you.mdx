## Overview

Bikes4you is a peer-to-peer web application designed to connect bicycle owners with individuals interested in renting bicycles. The platform serves purely as an intermediary, facilitating the connection between parties while leaving payment management outside its scope.

## Key Features

- **Bicycle Listing**: Owners can list their bicycles, set availability, and define rental prices.
- **Rental Requests**: Renters can browse available bicycles and request rentals.
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication using JWT.
- **Owner-Renter Communication**: Direct messaging between bicycle owners and renters.
- **Availability Management**: Owners can update bicycle availability in real-time.
- **No Payment Handling**: The platform only facilitates the connection without responsibility for payments.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for reliability
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for API development
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management
- **TypeORM**: ORM for database operations
- **React**: Frontend framework for interactive UI
- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS for dynamic styling
- **Material UI**: Pre-built UI components for consistency
- **JWT**: Secure authentication mechanism

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining security and data integrity. The team focused on optimizing database queries with TypeORM, securing authentication with JWT, and implementing a clean UI using Material UI and Styled Components.

## Outcome

Bikes4you successfully bridged the gap between bicycle owners and renters, creating an efficient and secure rental process. The project demonstrated the potential of peer-to-peer sharing in urban mobility and was well received by testers for its ease of use and reliability.
